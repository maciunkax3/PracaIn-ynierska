\section*{Abstract}
The following Engineering Thesis presents the project and the method of implementing a mobile application. The prepared program is meant to be used in order to perform card tricks. The application is dedicated for systems running the Android operating system. The paper presents the basics of operating and developing an application on such platform.  In order to implement the project, it was necessary to use the phone's built-in components. The components used were: the camera for the purpose of taking a picture, the NFC module in order to read and write information in tags placed on the playing cards, and a vibrator capable of vibrating the binary representation of the card. In addition, it was necessary to implement the ability to detect objects in the taken picture. Haar-like cascade classifiers were used to implement the detection. The operation of this solution has been described in the paper, as well as the process of training one's own cascade. The following chapters describe more specifically the key elements that make up the application, as well as the method of their implementation. The concepts needed to understand the operation of individual processes used to implement the project are also explained.
